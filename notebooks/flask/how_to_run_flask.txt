This script will run the flask script which contains the model as a pickled file.  This flask script (bot_classifier_w_flask.py) will keep running in the background listening at port '5000' until it gets a query from some script (query_flask.py) that is giving a twitter filehandle to that port.  The script for now is just using Kasey's bot classifier - I will later add vyas' classifier.

Go to directory where you will install stuff
mkdir flask_demo
cd flask_demo

# installing virtualenv; I run flask in a virtual environment.  The next 3 lines will create and get you inside a virtualenv
sudo easy_install virtualenv
virtualenv flask_demo_environment --python=/usr/bin/python2.7
source flask_demo_environment/bin/activate
pip install twitter flask gunicorn pandas sklearn scipy xgboost requests

git clone https://github.com/phattdoan/w210-russian-bots.git
cd w210-russian-bots/notebooks/

# this will cause the port 5000 to 'listen' for queries to it.  Running in backgroundâ€¦
# the script is called bot_classifier_w_flask.py
gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:5000 bot_classifier_w_flask:app &

# now query the port for twitter handle kaseyng53.  this will return a small subset of json information.  Can you use it ?
python query_flask.py kaseyng53
